        <h2><em>Biography</em></h2>
        <p> 
            My name is Michael Elder, and I am 25 years old. I played club soccer for over 12 years, and it consumed most of my time in my childhood. 
            After I was finished with soccer, I spent most of my time with friends but eventually thought about what I wanted to do with my career. 
            I wasn't sure for a while about which career path I wanted to takee. I eventually decided to change my career path to the tech industry.
            Here are a lot of aspects in my life that make me the person I am today such as education and extracurricular activities.
